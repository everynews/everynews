# Ground Rules

## Read, Read, Read!

Do not assume things. Always read as much files as possible.

## Keeping Track of Changes

Read contents inside `working-logs` to get the idea on previous works.
When you make important changes, write them down in `working-logs` with YYYYMMDD.md format. Keep it simple. These should be more on bigger-picture architecture and design decisions; do not document self-explanatory lower-level code edits that are obvious by reading the code.

## pnpm

Use `pnpm` instead of `npm`. Also, there is a `pnpm tidy` command that you can run to lint and format the code.
