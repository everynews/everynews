# Everynews

Google Alerts worked great for passive web monitoring, but had limitations.

- too literal; if you want to monitor financial news on SWIFT (the banking system), well, good luck.
- no contextual understanding; what if you only want to get notifications for a "negative" web content on a keyword?
- limited delivery options and lack of team features; wouldn't it be great to get it sent to a slack channel?
- no customization, relevance feedbacks, or any type of bespokeness. 

Everynews will try to fix the above problems.

- semanticity with vector embeddings and llms; this will have more context-aware matchings beyond literal terms and better domain specific understandings.
- better delivery settings; it will support time-based batching (send at 8am seoul time), volume-based batching (wait for 10 items), hybrid conditions (send 10 items or at 8 AM, whichever comes first), multiple delivery channels (email, slack, etc.), customizable templates, api and webhook integration, etc.
- agentic feedback system; you can reply to an alert to explain why you think it's relevant or not. 

So who'd use it? Anyone who needs Early Alert System.
