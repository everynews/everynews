Google Alerts worked great for passive web monitoring but had limitations.

- It's **too Literal**. If you want to monitor news on the SWIFT banking system, well, good luck.
- It had ** no contextual understanding **. What if you want to monitor *new models*, as in actual new fashion models debuting, not new AI models?
- **Limited delivery options, lack of team features**. Wouldn't it be great to send it to a Slack channel?

Everynews will try to fix the above problems.

- **Vector-based semanticity** with more context-aware matchings beyond literal terms and better domain-specific understandings.
- **Granular delivery settings** support time-based batching (send at 8 a.m. Seoul time), volume-based batching (wait for 10 items), hybrid conditions (send 10 items or at 8 a.m., whichever comes first), multiple delivery channels (email, Slack, etc.), customizable templates, APIs, and webhook integration, among other things.
- **Feedback systems**, such as replying to an alert explaining why you think it's relevant. Everynews will remember that feedback when composing the following alert.

Who'd use it?

- **Professionals** tracking personal brand monitoring, industry trends, etc.
- **Research teams** follow academic papers, monitor patents, etc.
- **Business teams** monitoring the market, competitor, brand sentiment, etc.
- **PR and Communications** assessing brand mentions, campaign performance, media coverage, etc.
