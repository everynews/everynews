              Hey there!
            </p>
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              every.news is in beta and things are literally on fire. APIs crash, notifications disappear into the void, and sometimes our AI decides to go completely rogue.
            </p>
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              But here's the thing â€” I actually give a damn about your experience.
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              So here's my promise.
            </p>
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              <strong>If you report a bug that's reasonably sized, I will personally fix it within 3 days.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              Not 3 weeks.
            </p>
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              Not "we'll get back to you."
            </p>
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              Not a ticket in some corporate queue.
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              <strong>3 days. Fixed. By me.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              Why can I promise this?
            </p>
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              Because it's just me building this thing right now. 
              No meetings, no approvals, no bureaucracy. Just code and coffee.
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              You'll get a personal response from me (yes, the actual founder) within hours. 
              I'll reproduce the bug, fix it, test it, and deploy it. Then I'll personally let you know it's done.
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              This isn't sustainable forever, but it's how we're rolling during beta. 
              Your experience matters more than anything else right now.
            </p>
            
            <p className='leading-relaxed mb-6'>
              Found something broken? Hit me up. Let's get it fixed.
            </p>

              Best,
