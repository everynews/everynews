# Everynews: Reimagining Google Alerts for 2025

## Problem Statement

Google Alerts, while pioneering passive web monitoring, has limitations in today's context:

- Literal keyword matching misses semantic relevance
- No contextual understanding or learning capabilities
- Limited delivery options and integration possibilities
- Lack of team collaboration features
- No customization for relevance scoring

## Core Concepts

### 1. Semantic Understanding

Instead of exact keyword matching, Everynews understands content through:

- Semantic search using embeddings and LLMs
- Context-aware matching beyond literal terms
- Evolving terminology tracking
- Domain-specific relevance understanding

### 2. Smart Batching

Addressing notification fatigue through intelligent delivery:

- Time-based batching ("Send at 8 AM")
- Volume-based batching ("Wait for 10 items")
- Hybrid conditions ("Send 10 items or at 8 AM, whichever comes first")
- Timezone-aware scheduling

### 3. Organization-First Design

Built for both individual and team use:

- Organizations as primary resource owners
- Seamless scaling from personal to team usage
- Resource sharing within organizations
- Role-based access control
- Team collaboration features

### 4. Flexible Delivery

Modern delivery options adapted to current workflows:

- Multiple delivery channels (email, Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Customizable templates
- API/webhook integration
- Custom channel development capability

### 5. Learning System

- Relevance scoring customization
- Organization-specific preferences
- Delivery optimization
- Pattern recognition for better matching
