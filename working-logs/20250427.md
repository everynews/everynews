# Everynews: Schema Design Decisions

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Organization-Based Ownership

**Decision**: All resources are owned by organizations rather than individual users.

**Rationale**:

- Simplifies multi-tenancy model
- Natural progression from personal to team usage
- Cleaner permission management
- Consistent sharing model
- Simplified billing and usage tracking

**Impact**:

- Users always operate within an organization context
- Resource access controlled through organization membership
- Sharing happens at the organization level
- Usage and limits tracked per organization

### 2. Resource Management

#### News Monitors

**Decision**: Unified news monitoring configuration with flexible scheduling and delivery.

**Key Aspects**:

- Organization-owned monitors
- Separation of search and delivery logic
- Configurable wait conditions
- Multiple delivery channel support

#### Delivery Management

**Decision**: Channel configurations separated from monitoring settings.

**Benefits**:

- Reusable delivery configurations
- Organization-wide channel sharing
- Independent channel management
- Flexible routing options

### 3. Schema Structure

#### Authentication System

**Decision**: Maintain existing authentication system with organization context.

**Components**:

- User management
- Session handling
- Multiple auth methods
- Organization context in sessions

#### Organization Layer

**Decision**: Organizations as primary ownership unit.

**Elements**:

- Organization profile
- Member management
- Role-based permissions
- Resource ownership

#### Monitoring System

**Decision**: Modular monitoring system with clear separation of concerns.

**Components**:

- News monitors
- Schedules
- Stories
- Delivery channels

### 4. Data Type Decisions

#### Configuration Storage

**Decision**: Use JSON fields for flexible configurations with schema validation.

**Areas**:

- Search configurations
- Relevance settings
- Wait conditions
- Channel configurations

#### Type Safety

**Decision**: Implement strong type checking and validation.

**Approach**:

- Schema validation for JSON fields
- Runtime type checking
- Strict TypeScript usage
- Clear type definitions

### 5. System Boundaries

#### Rate Limiting

**Decision**: Organization-based rate limiting implementation.

**Structure**:

- Per-organization limits
- Token bucket implementation
- Usage tracking
- Limit management

#### Access Control

**Decision**: Multi-level permission system.

**Layers**:

- Organization membership
- Role-based permissions
- Resource-level access
- API key scoping

## Migration Strategy

### User to Organization Transition

**Decision**: Clean migration path from user-based to organization-based model.

**Steps**:

- Personal organization creation
- Resource ownership transfer
- Permission mapping
- API key migration

### Data Integrity

**Decision**: Maintain data consistency during schema changes.

**Approach**:

- Atomic migrations
- Data validation
- Rollback capability
- Version tracking

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

**Decision**: Design for horizontal scalability from the start.

**Areas**:

- Monitor execution
- Result processing
- Delivery handling
- Usage tracking

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Optimize for high-volume data processing.

**Focus**:

- Query optimization
- Index strategy
- Batch processing
- Caching strategy

## Monitoring and Observability

### System Health

**Decision**: Comprehensive health tracking implementation.

**Metrics**:

- Monitor execution
- Delivery success
- Error rates
- Performance metrics

### Usage Analytics

**Decision**: Detailed usage tracking per organization.

**Tracking**:

- Search volume
- Delivery patterns
- Resource utilization
- API usage

## Future Extensibility

### Schema Evolution

**Decision**: Design for future feature additions.

**Areas**:

- New channel types
- Additional configurations
- Feature flags
- Version control

### Integration Capabilities

**Decision**: Prepare for external system integration.

**Considerations**:

- API design
- Webhook support
- External service integration
- Custom channel development
